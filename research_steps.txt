1. Select set of articles with invalid keywords from http://www.global.asc.upenn.edu/app/uploads/2014/06/citation_filtered_1-1.pdf

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.6398v1.pdf

2. Create Span comparison:
Select set of articles with
where pageviews more than doubled
article viewed more than 10 per day in Iran after the transition
ranked by normalized wdc_view_proporrtion_delta

3. test p-value for getting those ranks


4. Find more examples of articles that have a ts like the ones above

Pick some canonical set of ts and ask labeler to assess the degree of resemblance
Is similar or dissimilar to any of the above?
Slider starts at 0. move  from 1 to -1.

5. 2 types of examples:

50% random sample
50% examples from list of top changing articles
Labeler does not know what is what
Do not show the titles


6.
Train NN on:

6.1. [0-1] bounded raw/smoothed series
6.2. proportions
6.3. summary stats
6.4. Architecture
6.5. Make sure to weigh negative examples

7. Report Accuracy and Spearman



what fraction of candidates labeled similar



8. Apply Model to all Iran Series
8.1 Give an analysis of top k articles that where blocked

9. Apply Model to all Series
- publish top [0,1] normed series
